TensorFlow is a relatively large framework, with an unpacked size of approximately 1.7 GB. The size of such frameworks is an important consideration for several reasons:  

- **üìú Historical Constraints:** Previously, AWS Lambda imposed a limit of `50 MB` for package sizes. While Docker has since increased these limits to 10 GB, the size of the framework still plays a crucial role in certain scenarios.
- **‚ö° Performance Issues with Large Images:** Large frameworks like TensorFlow result in increased storage costs, longer initialization times (e.g., for invoking a Lambda function), slower loading times, and a significantly larger RAM footprint.  

### Optimizing with TensorFlow Lite üöÄ  
To address these challenges, TensorFlow Lite (TF-Lite) provides a lightweight alternative designed specifically for inference tasks (i.e., making predictions with `model.predict(X)`), excluding any other functionality such as training. To use TensorFlow Lite, the original TensorFlow model needs to be converted into the TF-Lite format. This process can significantly reduce model size and improve performance.  


## Notes

New URL for downloading the model:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/releases/download/chapter7-model/xception_v4_large_08_0.894.h5 -O clothing-model.h5
```

Add notes from the video (PRs are welcome)

* tensorflow has a size of approximately 1.7 GB
* there are size limits of cloud services and docker container
* tensorflow lite is small in size and limited to using a model to make predictions (inference)
* convert tensorflow keras model to a tensorflow lite model
